              <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://justnote.cc">https://justnote.cc</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "Justnote"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website. We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our website. Depending on your activities when visiting our website, you may be required to agree to additional Terms of Use.</p>
              <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
              <p>Justnote may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. If we do collect, the purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is only to better understand how Justnote's visitors use its website. Justnote may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
              <p>Justnote may collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. If we do collect, the purpose in collecting potentially personally-identifying information is only to better understand how Justnote's visitors use its website. Justnote only discloses potentially personally-identifying information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
              <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
              <p>Certain visitors to Justnote's websites choose to interact with Justnote in ways that require Justnote to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Justnote gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at https://justnote.cc to provide a username and email address.</p>
              <h3>Security</h3>
              <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
              <h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
              <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of every site you visit.</p>
              <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
              <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
              <p>Justnote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Justnote's behalf or to provide services available at Justnote's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Justnote's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Justnote will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Justnote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Justnote believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Justnote, third parties or the public at large.</p>
              <p>If you are a registered user of https://justnote.cc and have supplied your email address, Justnote may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Justnote and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Justnote takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
              <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
              <p>Justnote may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Justnote may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Justnote does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>Justnote does not use "Cookies". We use local storage provided by your browser to store your preferences which is considered safer and more privacy friendly. The purpose is to display personalized content, enrich and perfect your online experience.</p>
              <p>There is a string of information that our website stores in your browser's local storage, and that your browser provides to our website each time you return. Justnote uses this to help identify and track visitors, their usage of https://justnote.cc, and their website access preferences. Justnote visitors who do not wish to allow this should set their browsers to disable local storage before using Justnote, with the drawback that certain features of Justnote may not function properly.</p>
              <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your browser's local storage settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Justnote's use of local storage.</p>
